- With **more data** and **computing resources**, the things that we can ask and do with networks are becoming increasingly (even more) exciting and complex.

- In this section, I will introduce **some** of the latest advancements and forthcoming topics in network modeling.

## Part I: New models and extensions {background-color="black"}

## Mutli-ERGMs

- In @krivitskyTaleTwoDatasets2023a, the authors present a start-to-finish pooled ERGM example featuring heterogeneous data sources.

- They increase power and allow exploring heterogeneous effects across types/classes of networks.

## Statistical power of SOAM

::: {.fragment style="font-size: 80%"}
- **SOAM** @stadtfeldStatisticalPowerLongitudinal2020 proposes ways to perform power analysis for Siena models. At the center of their six-step approach is simulation.

## Bayesian ALAAM

Ever wondered how to model influence exclusively?

- The Auto-Logistic Actor Attribute Model [ALAAM] is a model that allows us to do just that.
- @koskinenBayesianAnalysisSocial2022 extends the ALAAM model to a Bayesian framework.

- It provides greater flexibility to accommodate more complicated models and add extensions such as hierarchical models.

## Relational Event Models

- REMs are great for modeling sequences of ties (instead of panel or cross-sectional.)

-  @buttsRelationalEventModels2023 provides a general overview of Relational Event Models [REMs,] new methods, and future steps.

## Big ERGMs

- **ERGMs** In @stivalaExponentialRandomGraph2020a, a new method is proposed to estimate large ERGMs (featuring millions of nodes).

## Exponential Random *Network* Models

- Wang, Fellows, and Handcock recently published a re-introduction of the ERNM framework [@wangUnderstandingNetworksExponentialfamily2023].

- ERNMs generalize ERGMs to incorporate behavior and are the cross-sectional causing of SIENA models.

\begin{align*}
\text{ER\textbf{G}M}: & \Prergm(\bm{{Y}}=\bm{{y}} | \bm{{X}}=\bm{{x}}) \\
\text{ER\textbf{N}M}: & \Prergm(\bm{{Y}}=\bm{{y}}, \bm{{X}}=\bm{{x}})
\end{align*}

## Part II: Shameless self-promotion {background-color="black"}

## ERGMitos: Small ERGMs

- **ERGMitos**[^ito] [@vegayonExponentialRandomGraph2021] leverage small network sizes to use exact statistics.

[^ito]: From the Spanish suffix meaning small.

## Discrete Exponential-family Models {style="font-size: 0.8em;"}

- ERGMs are a particular case of Random Markov fields.

- We can use the ERGM framework for modeling vectors of binary outcomes, e.g., the consumption of $\{tobacco, MJ, alcohol\}$

## Power analysis in ERGMs

- Using conditional ERGMs (closely related to constrained), we can do power analysis for network samples [@vegayonPowerMulticollinearitySmall2023].

## Two-step estimation ERGMs

::: {style="font-size: 0.7em;"}

- Conditioning the ERGM on an observed statistic "drops" the associated coefficient.

- Hypothesis: As $n$ increases, conditional ERGM estimates are consistent with the full model:

## Thanks!

## Bonus track: Why network scientists don't use ERGMs?

> Attempts to overcome these problems by extending the blockmodel have focused particularly on the use of (more complicated) $p^*$ or exponential random graph models, but **while these are conceptually appealing**, they quickly **lose the analytic tractability** of the original blockmodel **as their complexity increases**.
