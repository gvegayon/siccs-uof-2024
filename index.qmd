Here, you will find three subpages with the following content: (1) Fundamentals about R and Statistics, (2) Introduction to ERGMs, (3) Advanced ERGMs, and (4) New topics in Network Modeling.

# References

Although not all about ERGMs, the following list of references is an excellent resource for statistical inference in network science.
