  abstract = {The last two decades have seen considerable progress in foundational aspects of statistical network analysis, but the path from theory to application is not straightforward. Two large, heterogeneous samples of small networks of within-household contacts in Belgium were collected using two different but complementary sampling designs: one smaller but with all contacts in each household observed, the other larger and more representative but recording contacts of only one person per household. We wish to combine their strengths to learn the social forces that shape household contact formation and facilitate simulation for prediction of disease spread, while generalising to the population of households in the region. To accomplish this, we describe a flexible framework for specifying multi-network models in the exponential family class and identify the requirements for inference and prediction under this framework to be consistent, identifiable, and generalisable, even when data are incomplete; explore how these requirements may be violated in practice; and develop a suite of quantitative and graphical diagnostics for detecting violations and suggesting improvements to candidate models. We report on the effects of network size, geography, and household roles on household contact patterns (activity, heterogeneity in activity, and triadic closure). Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

However, those ERGMs modeling the more complex features have, to date, been limited to binary data: presence or absence of ties. Thus, analysis of valued networks, such as those where counts, measurements, or ranks are observed, has necessitated dichotomizing them, losing information and introducing biases. In this work, we generalize ERGMs to valued networks. Focusing on modeling counts, we formulate an ERGM for networks whose ties are counts and discuss issues that arise when moving beyond the binary case. We introduce model terms that generalize and model common social network features for such data and apply these methods to a network dataset whose values are counts of interactions.},

Much of this research has focused on social networks within medium to large social groups. To date, these advances in statistical models for social networks, and in particular, of Exponential-Family Random Graph Models (ERGMS), have rarely been applied to the study of small networks, despite small network data in teams, families, and personal networks being common in many fields. In this paper, we revisit the estimation of ERGMs for small networks and propose using exhaustive enumeration when possible. We developed an R package that implements the estimation of pooled ERGMs for small networks using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), called ``ergmito''. Based on the results of an extensive simulation study to assess the properties of the MLE estimator, we conclude that there are several benefits of direct MLE estimation compared to approximate methods and that this creates opportunities for valuable methodological innovations that can be applied to modeling social networks with ERGMs.},

  abstract = {"Exponential random graph models (ERGMs) are a class of statistical models for social networks. They account for the presence (and absence) of network ties and so provide a model for network structure. An ERGM models a given network in terms of small local tie-based structures, such as reciprocated ties and triangles. A social network can be thought of as being built up of these local patterns of ties, called network configurations xe "network configurations" , which correspond to the parameters in the model. Moreover, these configurations can be considered to arise from local social processes, whereby actors in the network form connections in response to other ties in their social environment. ERGMs are a principled statistical approach to modeling social networks. They are theory-driven in that their use requires the researcher to consider the complex, intersecting and indeed potentially competing theoretical reasons why the social ties in the observed network have arisen. For instance, does a given network structure occur due to processes of homophily xe "actor-relation effects:homophily" , xe "homophily" {\textbackslash}t "see actor-relation effects" reciprocity xe "reciprocity" , transitivity xe "transitivity" , or indeed a combination of these? By including such parameters together in the one model a researcher can test these effects one against the other, and so infer the social processes that have built the network. Being a statistical model, an ERGM permits inferences about whether, in our network of interest, there are significantly more (or fewer) reciprocated ties, or triangles (for instance), than we would expect"--},

One thousand four hundred and twenty-five racially and ethnically diverse youth from four high schools in Los Angeles were surveyed four times over the high school period from 2010 to 2013. Probit regression models and stochastic actor-based models for network dynamics tested for peer effects on smoking initiation. Friend smoking was found to predict adolescent smoking, and smoking initiation diffused through friendship networks in some but not all of the schools. School differences in smoking rates and the popularity of smokers may be linked to differences in the diffusion of smoking through peer networks. We conclude that there are differences in peer effects on smoking initiation across schools that will be important to account for in network-based smoking interventions.},

Several factors affect diffusion such as the characteristics of the initial adopters, the seeds; the structure of the network over which diffusion occurs; and the shape of the threshold distribution, which is the proportion of prior adopting peers needed for the focal individual to adopt. In this study, seven seeding conditions are modeled: (1) three opinion leadership indicators, (2) two bridging measures, (3) marginally positioned seeds, and (4) randomly selected seeds for comparison. Three network structures are modeled: (1) random, (2) small-world, and (3) scale-free. Four threshold distributions are modeled: (1) normal; (2) uniform; (3) beta 7,14; and (4) beta 1,2; all of which have a mean threshold of 33\%, with different variances. The results show that seeding with nodes high on in-degree centrality and/or inverse constraint has faster and more widespread diffusion. Random networks had faster and higher prevalence of diffusion than scale-free ones, but not different from small-world ones. Compared with the normal threshold distribution, the uniform one had faster diffusion and the beta 7,14 distribution had slower diffusion. Most significantly, the threshold distribution standard deviation was associated with rate and prevalence such that higher threshold standard deviations accelerated diffusion and increased prevalence. These results underscore factors that health educators and public health advocates should consider when developing interventions or trying to understand the potential for behavior change.}

We examine implementation of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) adopted by the World Health Organization in 2003 and ratified by approximately 94\% of countries as of 2016. We constructed five networks: (1) geographic distance, (2) general trade, (3) tobacco trade, (4) GLOBALink referrals, and (5) GLOBALink co-subscriptions. Network exposure terms were constructed from these networks based on the implementation scores for six articles of the FCTC treaty. We estimate effects using a lagged Type 1 Tobit model. Results show that network effects were significant: (a) across all networks for article 6 (pricing and taxation), (b) distance, general trade, GL referrals, and GL co-subscriptions for article 8 (second hand smoke), (c) distance, general trade, and GL co-subscriptions for article 11 (packaging and labeling), and (d) distance and GL co-subscription for article 13 (promotion and advertising), (e) tobacco trade and GL co-subscriptions for article 14 (cessation). These results indicate that diffusion effects were more prevalent for pricing and taxation as well as restrictions on smoking in public places and packaging and labeling. These results suggest that network influences are possible in domains that are amenable to control by national governments but unlikely to occur in domains established by existing regulatory systems. Implications for future studies of policy implementation are discussed.},

Because eating is often habitual (i.e., automatically driven by external cues), unconscious behavioral mimicry may be a key interpersonal influence mechanism for eating within families. This pilot study extends existing literature on eating mimicry by examining whether multiple family members mimicked each other's bites during natural meals. Thirty-Three participants from 10 families were videotaped while eating an unstructured family meal in a kitchen lab setting. Videotapes were coded for participants' bite occurrences and times. We tested whether the likelihood of a participant taking a bite increased when s/he was externally cued by a family eating partner who had recently taken a bite (i.e., bite mimicry). A paired-sample t-Test indicated that participants had a significantly faster eating rate within the 5 s following a bite by their eating partner, compared to their bite rate at other times (t = 7.32, p {$<$} .0001). Nonparametric permutation testing identified five of 78 dyads in which there was significant evidence of eating mimicry; and 19 of 78 dyads that had p values {$<$} .1. This pilot study provides preliminary evidence that suggests eating mimicry may occur among a subset of family members, and that there may be types of family ties more prone to this type of interpersonal influence during meals.},

Here, we propose a theoretical framework to categorize three classes of errors we call imaginary network motifs as combinations of accurately and erroneously perceived ties: (a) partially false, (b) completely false, and (c) mixed false. Using four published CSS data sets, we empirically test which imaginary network motifs are significantly more or less present in different types of perceived networks than the corresponding actual networks. Our results confirm that people not only fill in the blanks as suggested in the prior research but also conceive other imaginary structures. The findings advance our understanding of perception gaps between actual and perceived networks and have implications for designing more accurate network modeling and sampling.},

Exponential-family Random Graph Models (ERGM) have shown themselves to be a useful class of models for representing complex social phenomena. We generalize ERGM by also modeling nodal attributes as random variates, thus creating a random model of the full network, which we call Exponential-family Random Network Models (ERNM). We demonstrate how this framework allows a new formulation for logistic regression in network data. We develop likelihood-based inference for the model in the case of a fully observed network and an MCMC algorithm to implement it. We then develop a theory of inference for ERNM when only part of the network is observed, as well as specific methodology for missing data, including non-ignorable mechanisms for network-based sampling designs and for latent class models. We also consider contact tracing sampling designs which are of considerable importance to infectious disease epidemiology and public health. This culminates in a treatment of respondent driven sampling (RDS), which is a widely used link tracing design.},

  abstract = {Misinterpretation and abuse of statistical tests, confidence intervals, and statistical power have been decried for decades, yet remain rampant. A key problem is that there are no interpretations of these concepts that are at once simple, intuitive, correct, and foolproof. Instead, correct use and interpretation of these statistics requires an attention to detail which seems to tax the patience of working scientists. This high cognitive demand has led to an epidemic of shortcut definitions and interpretations that are simply wrong, sometimes disastrously so{\textemdash}and yet these misinterpretations dominate much of the scientific literature. In light of this problem, we provide definitions and a discussion of basic statistics that are more general and critical than typically found in traditional introductory expositions. Our goal is to provide a resource for instructors, researchers, and consumers of statistics whose knowledge of statistical theory and technique may be limited but who wish to avoid and spot misinterpretations. We emphasize how violation of often unstated analysis protocols (such as selecting analyses for presentation based on the P values they produce) can lead to small P values even if the declared test hypothesis is correct, and can lead to large P values even if that hypothesis is incorrect. We then provide an explanatory list of 25 misinterpretations of P values, confidence intervals, and power. We conclude with guidelines for improving statistical interpretation and reporting.},

However, in a world in which measurements are noisy and effects are small, this will not work: selection on statistical significance leads to effect sizes which are overestimated and often in the wrong direction. After a brief discussion of two examples, one in economics and one in social psychology, we consider the procedural solution of open postpublication review, the design solution of devoting more effort to accurate measurements and within-person comparisons, and the statistical analysis solution of multilevel modeling and reporting all results rather than selection on significance. We argue that the current replication crisis in science arises in part from the ill effects of null hypothesis significance testing being used to study small effects with noisy data. In such settings, apparent success comes easy but truly replicable results require a more serious connection between theory, measurement, and data.},

From one realization of such a Markov chain, a Monte Carlo approximant to the whole likelihood function can be constructed. The parameter value (if any) maximizing this function approximates the MLE. When no parameter point in the model maximizes the likelihood, the MLE in the closure of the exponential family may exist and can be calculated by a two-phase algorithm, first finding the support of the MLE by linear programming and then finding the distribution within the family conditioned on the support by maximizing the likelihood for that family. These methods are illustrated by a constrained autologistic model for DNA fingerprint data. MLEs are compared with maximum pseudolikelihood estimates (MPLEs) and with maximum conditional likelihood estimates (MCLEs), neither of which produce acceptable estimates, the MPLE because it overestimates dependence, and the MCLE because conditioning removes the constraints.},

We could take the example of a cognitive social structure where there is another type of tie connecting the actors that provide the reports; or the study of interpersonal spillover effects from one cultural domain to another facilitated by the social ties. Another example is when the individual semantic structures are represented as semantic networks of a group of actors and connected through these actors' social ties to constitute knowledge of a social group. How to jointly represent the two types of networks is not trivial as the layers and not the nodes of the layers of the reported networks are coupled through a network on the reports. We propose to transform the different multiple networks using line graphs, where actors are affiliated with ties represented as nodes, and represent the totality of the different types of ties as a multilevel network. This affords studying the associations between the social network and the reports as well as the alignment of the reports to a criterion graph. We illustrate how the procedure can be applied to studying the social construction of knowledge in local flood management groups. Here we use multilevel exponential random graph models but the representation also lends itself to stochastic actor-oriented models, multilevel blockmodels, and any model capable of handling multilevel networks.},

@article{Slaughter2016,
   abstract = {In many applications, researchers may be interested in studying patterns of dyadic relationships that involve multiple groups, with a focus on modeling the systematic patterns within groups and how these structural patterns differ across groups. A number of different models - many of them potentially quite powerful - have been developed that allow for researchers to study these differences. However, as with any set of models, these are limited in ways that constrain the types of questions researchers may ask, such as those involving the variance in group-wise structural features. In this paper, we demonstrate some of the ways in which multilevel models based on a hierarchical Bayesian approach might be used to further develop and extend existing exponential random graph models to address such constraints. These include random coefficient extensions to the standard ERGM for sets of multiple unconnected or connected networks and examples of multilevel models that allow for the estimation of structural entrainment among connected groups. We demonstrate the application of these models to real-world and simulated data sets.},

  abstract = {Exponential-family models for dependent data have applications in a wide variety of areas, but the dependence often results in an intractable likelihood, requiring either analytic approximation or MCMC-based techniques to fit, the latter requiring an initial parameter configuration to seed their simulations. A poor initial configuration can lead to slow convergence or outright failure. The approximate techniques that could be used to find them tend not to be as general as the simulation-based and require implementation separate from that of the MLE-finding algorithm. Contrastive divergence is a more recent simulation-based approximation technique that uses a series of abridged MCMC runs instead of running them to stationarity. Combining it with the importance sampling Monte Carlo MLE yields a method for obtaining adequate initial values that is applicable to a wide variety of modeling scenarios. Practical issues such as stopping criteria and selection of tuning parameters are also addressed. A simple generalization of the Monte Carlo MLE partial stepping algorithm to curved exponential families (applicable to MLE-finding as well) is also proposed. The proposed approach reuses the aspects of an MLE implementation that are model-specific, so little to no additional implementer effort is required to obtain adequate initial parameters. This is demonstrated on a series of network datasets and models drawn from exponential-family random graph model computation literature, also exploring the limitations of the techniques considered.},

  abstract = {Social science research increasingly benefits from statistical methods for understanding the structured nature of social life, including for social network data. However, the application of statistical network models within large-scale community research is hindered by too little understanding of the validity of their inferences under realistic data collection conditions, including sampled or missing network data. The autologistic actor attribute model (ALAAM) is a statistical model based on the well-established exponential random graph model (ERGM) for social networks. ALAAMs can be regarded as a social influence model, predicting an individual-level outcome based on the actor's network ties, concurrent outcomes of his/her network partners, and attributes of the actor and his/her network partners. In particular, an ALAAM can be used to measure contagion effects, that is, the propensity of two actors connected by a social network tie to both have the same value of an attribute. We investigate the effect of using simple random samples and snowball samples of network data on ALAAM parameter inference, and find that parameter inference can still work well even with a nontrivial fraction of missing nodes. However it is safer to take a snowball sample of the network and estimate conditional on the snowball sampling structure.},

  abstract = {Relational event models are a powerful tool to examine how conflicts arise or manifest through human interactions and how they evolve over time. Building on event history analysis, these models combine network dependencies with temporal dynamics and allow for the analysis of group formation patterns{\textemdash}such as alliance or coalition formation processes{\textemdash}influencing dynamics or social learning. The added information on both the timing (and order) of social interactions as well as the context in which social interactions take place (i.e., the broader network in which people or actors are embedded in) can give powerful new evidence to theorized social mechanisms. This chapter provides an overview of REMs and showcases two empirical studies to illustrate the approach. The first study examines political alliance-formation patterns among countries engaging in military actions in the Gulf region. The REM shows that countries engage in military actions with other countries by balancing their relations, i.e., by supporting allies of their allies and opposing enemies of their allies. The second study shows that party family homophily guides parliamentary veto decisions and provides empirical evidence of social influencing dynamics among European parliaments.},

  abstract = {A class of models is proposed for longitudinal network data. These models are along the lines of methodological individualism: actors use heuristics to try to achieve their individual goals, subject to constraints. The current net- work structure is among these constraints. The models are continuous time Markov chain models that can be implemented as simulation models. They incorporate random change in addition to the purposeful change that follows from the actors' pursuit of their goals, and include parameters that must be estimated from observed data. Statistical methods are proposed for estimat- ing and testing these models. These methods can also be used for parameter estimation for other simulation models. The statistical procedures are based on the method of moments, and use computer simulation to estimate the theoretical moments. The Robbins-Monro process is used to deal with the stochastic nature of the estimated theoretical moments. An example is given for Newcomb's fraternity data, using a model that expresses reciprocity and balance.},
