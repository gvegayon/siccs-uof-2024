The `ergm` package comes with a handful of vignettes (extended R examples) that you can use to learn more about the package. The vignette with the same name as the package shows an example fitting a model to the network `faux.mesa.high`. Address the following questions:

a. What type of ERG model is this?

b. Looking at the plot in the vignette, what other term(s) could you consider worth adding to the model? Why? 

c. The vignette did not include a goodness-of-fit analysis. Can you add one? What do you find?

d. **Challenge**: without using `ergm` to fit the model, estimate the following $p1$ model: `~ edges + nodefactor("Race")`. Compare your results with what you get using `ergm`.
